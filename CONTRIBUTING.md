## 🔀 Pull Request Policy

> ✅ **Pull requests are welcome – but only on the `dev` branch.**

### ✅ Please:
- **Always** base your PRs on the `dev` branch, not `main`.
- Make sure your code is clean and tested locally before submitting.
- Include a short description of the problem/feature you’re addressing.
- Keep your commits atomic and clear (e.g. avoid "fix stuff" as a commit message).

### ❌ Avoid:
- Pushing directly to the `main` branch (it's protected).
- Opening PRs for design experiments without context or explanation.
- Submitting large UI overhauls without discussion.
